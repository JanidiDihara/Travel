                  <h3>Eiffel Tower</h3>
                  <h4>2018.05.30</h4>
                  <p>The Eiffel Tower (/ˈaɪfəl/ EYE-fəl; French: tour Eiffel [tuʁ‿ɛfɛl] (listen)) is a wrought-iron lattice tower on the Champ de Mars in Paris, France. It is named after the engineer Gustave Eiffel, whose company designed and built the tower.

Locally nicknamed "La dame de fer" (French for "Iron Lady"), it was constructed from 1887 to 1889 as the centerpiece of the 1889 World's Fair. Although initially criticised by some of France's leading artists and intellectuals for its design, it has since become a global cultural icon of France and one of the most recognisable structures in the world.[3] The Eiffel Tower is the most visited monument with an entrance fee in the world: 6.91 million people ascended it in 2015. It was designated a monument historique in 1964, and was named part of a UNESCO World Heritage Site ("Paris, Banks of the Seine") in 1991.[4].</p>

                  <h3>Santa Maria della Salute</h3>
                  <h4>2019.07.20</h4>
                  <p>Santa Maria della Salute (English: Saint Mary of Health),
                    commonly known simply as the Salute, is a Roman Catholic church
                    and minor basilica located at Punta della Dogana in the Dorsoduro
                    sestiere of the city of Venice, Italy.
                    It stands on the narrow finger of Punta della Dogana,
                    between the Grand Canal and the Giudecca Canal, at
                    the Bacino di San Marco, making the church visible when entering the
                     Piazza San Marco from the water. The Salute is part of the parish
                      of the Gesuati and is the most recent of the so-called plague churches.

In 1630, Venice experienced an unusually devastating outbreak of the plague. As a votive offering for the city's deliverance from the pestilence, the Republic of Venice vowed to build and dedicate a church to Our Lady of Health. The church was designed in the then fashionable Baroque style by Baldassare Longhena, who studied under the architect Vincenzo Scamozzi. Construction began in 1631. Most of the objects of art housed in the church bear references to the Black Death..</p>

                  <h4>2020.04.25</h4>
                  <p>At the Top is an outdoor observation deck on the Burj Khalifa. It opened on 5 January 2010 on the 124th floor. At 452 m (1,483 ft), it was the highest outdoor observation deck in the world when it opened.[1] [2][3]

Although it was surpassed in December 2011 by Cloud Top 488 on the Canton Tower,
Guangzhou at 488 m (1,601 ft),[4] Burj Khalifa opened the 148th floor SKY level at 555 m (1,821 ft),
once again giving it the highest observation deck in the world on 15 October 2014,[5][6] until the Shanghai Tower opened in June 2016 with an observation deck at a height of 561 metres.[7] The 124th floor observation deck also features the electronic telescope, an augmented reality device developed by Gsmprjct° of Montréal, which allows visitors to view the surrounding landscape in real-time, and to view previously saved images such as those taken at different times of day or under different weather conditions.[8][9][10] To reduce the daily rush of sightseers,
management allows visitors to purchase tickets in advance for a specific date and time, at a 75% discount on tickets purchased on the spot.[11]
On 8 February 2010, the observation deck was closed to the public for two months after power-supply problems caused an elevator to become stuck between floors, trapping a group of tourists for 45 minutes.[12][13][14][15][16].</p>
